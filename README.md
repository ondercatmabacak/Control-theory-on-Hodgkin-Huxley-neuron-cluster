# Control-theory-on-Hodgkin-Huxley-neuron-cluster
We used Hodgkin-Huxley neuron system and manipulated it by sending electric signals to only one neuron. 
Two different Control theory methods (Speed Gradient and Target attractor) were used in this study. 
Results shows us that it is mathematically possible that epileptic seizures can be suppressed before even started.
